Though my place was not near to the coast of the city of Iwaki, where suffered the most, there were a lot of concerns for residents, especially for students. They had to study in the gymnasium with partitions, in the laboratories, or any place available to utilize until temporary facilities were built. By the destructive mainshock, the campus was obliterated. Fukushima and the areas nearby Fukushima were running out of resource such as a gas, foods, beverages for a half year. I got used to the routine that my family woke up at 4 am or so and waited in line to ensure that we could get those resources before they got out of stock. I, as a student, had to kept myself under control and focused on what I needed to do for my later life especially because I faced the annual national exam for university just after 10 months. It turned out well academically, and fortunately now I get a chance to study further in United States. I believe that I can acquire top-notch skills and knowledge at a selective university, and that will give me the capacity to meaningfully help my community. I hope that my contribution will become one of the variables of resistant community toward natural disasters that I had experienced at high school.",
            'history_2': "In 2012, I got accepted by Shibaura Institute of Technology, Engineering and Design. At the university I learnt the areas of architecture, product design, manufacturing, and computer science in the first two years, and then I chose CS for my major. In junior year, in the hope of seeing how graduates with CS degree interact with the society daily, I decided to have a job at tech-company.  Thankfully, in spite of the fact that they had never hired a part-time employee before, GREE, inc., which awarded the epithet \"one of three biggest startup since 2000\", offered me a customer service job. I chiefly dealt with different kinds of customers' troubles in the usage of GREE online games. With this data I helped developers to make better strategies and policies as well. Although I did not belong to technical teams to develop games, I met various people who are highly skilled in his/her profession, are globally experienced, or are foreigners. After all, I thought I needed to explore technical skills to see how CS students make an effort for company, more broadly for my community. I gained a next job at another tech-company as a system engineer, and I skilled in web development. I took several responsibilities in the company, but more importantly I worked with a lot of foreign programmers from French, Spain, Mexico, China, which was unconventionally diverse in Japan. These two environments reshaped my stereotypical ideas on how different each cultures are, but at the same time how similar we perceive and feel, and reminded me of the value of English.",

The global experience would allow me to make valuable contributions to society with the personal capacity to facilitate communications between different nations and different people.
